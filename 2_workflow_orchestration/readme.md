## Week 2: Workflow Orchestration

### Data Lake (GCS)
* What is a Data Lake
  * Data Lake is a system or repository of data stored in natural/raw format.
  * Users: Data Scientist, and Data Analysts
  * Usecases: Stream Processing, Real-time analysis, Machine learning.
  * Usage: store and access data as soon as possible.
  * Gotcha of Data Lake
    * Converting into Data Swamp
    * No versioning
    * Incompatiple schemas for same data without versioning
    * No metadata associated
    * Joins not possible
* ELT vs. ETL
  * ELT for large amounts of data: Data Lake. Provides Schema on Read.
  * ETL for a small amount of data: Data Warehouse
* Alternatives to components (S3/HDFS, Redshift, Snowflake etc.)
  * GCP - Cloud
  * AWS - S3
  * AZURE - AZURE Blob
